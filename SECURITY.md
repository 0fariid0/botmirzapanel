# Security Improvements for Mirza Panel Bot

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to the Mirza Panel Bot project to address various vulnerabilities and enhance overall security.

## Fixed Security Issues

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
- **Issue**: Direct variable interpolation in SQL queries, particularly in LIMIT clauses
- **Fix**: Implemented proper parameter binding using PDO prepared statements
- **Files affected**: `index.php`, `functions.php`

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerability
- **Issue**: Use of `shell_exec()` for cron management without proper sanitization
- **Fix**: Removed dangerous shell_exec usage and added manual setup instructions
- **Files affected**: `index.php`

### 3. Insecure Database Connections
- **Issue**: Poor error handling and missing connection validation
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling, connection testing, and security headers
- **Files affected**: `config.php`

### 4. Input Validation Issues
- **Issue**: Insufficient input sanitization and validation
- **Fix**: Enhanced sanitization functions and added comprehensive validation
- **Files affected**: `functions.php`

### 5. SSL/TLS Security
- **Issue**: Disabled SSL verification in cURL requests
- **Fix**: Enabled proper SSL verification and certificate validation
- **Files affected**: `functions.php`

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Input Sanitization
```php
function sanitizeUserName($userName) {
    // Comprehensive character filtering
    // Non-printable character removal
    // Length limitations
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper error logging
- Removed sensitive information from error messages
- Implemented graceful error handling

### 3. Security Headers
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content Security Policy

### 4. Access Control
- Enhanced IP validation for Telegram webhooks
- Improved file access restrictions
- Protected sensitive directories

### 5. Database Security
- Prepared statements for all queries
- Table name validation
- Connection encryption

## Configuration Security

### 1. Environment Variables
- Created `.env.example` template
- Separated sensitive configuration
- Added configuration validation

### 2. File Permissions
- Protected configuration files
- Restricted access to sensitive directories
- Added proper .htaccess rules

## Recommendations

### 1. Manual Setup Required
Due to security concerns, the following must be set up manually:

#### Cron Jobs
```bash
# Add this to your crontab manually:
*/1 * * * * curl https://yourdomain.com/bot/cron/sendmessage.php
```

#### Environment Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure all required variables
3. Set proper file permissions (600)

### 2. Regular Security Maintenance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor error logs regularly
- Review access logs for suspicious activity
- Update Telegram IP ranges as needed

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request logging
- Use HTTPS only
- Regular security audits

## Security Testing

### 1. Automated Testing
```bash
composer security-check
```

### 2. Manual Testing
- Test input validation
- Verify SQL injection protection
- Check file access restrictions
- Validate error handling
